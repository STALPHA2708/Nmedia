# 🚀 DEPLOY FIXES TO FLY.DEV NOW

## 🎯 **The Problem:**

You can't access localhost:8080 because it's running in the cloud dev environment, not your local computer.

## ✅ **The Solution:**

Deploy the invoice status fixes to your live Fly.dev environment.

---

## 🚀 **DEPLOYMENT OPTIONS:**

### **Option 1: Use Builder.io Deploy Button (Recommended)**

1. Look for **Deploy**, **Push**, or **🚀** button in Builder.io interface
2. Click it to deploy latest changes to Fly.dev
3. Wait 3-5 minutes for deployment
4. Refresh your Fly.dev URL to get the fixed version

### **Option 2: Manual Git Push**

If you have local access to the repo:

```bash
git pull # Get latest changes from Builder.io
git push origin main # Deploy to Fly.dev
```

## 🔧 **What Gets Fixed After Deployment:**

- ✅ **Invoice status changes work** (no more 400 errors)
- ✅ **Confirm button functions properly**
- ✅ **All invoice operations work correctly**

---

## ⏰ **Timeline:**

- **Deploy:** 1-2 minutes
- **Fly.dev build:** 2-3 minutes
- **Total:** ~5 minutes until fixes are live

## 🧪 **Test After Deployment:**

1. **Stay on:** `https://34027b7a34ca4f8b972943d7f44e7dcb-7c7b068a5f884d1fb7dcfd3f0.fly.dev`
2. **Refresh the page** after deployment
3. **Test invoice status changes** - they should work without 400 errors!
